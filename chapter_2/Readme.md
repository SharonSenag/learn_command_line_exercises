>1) What directory are you in?

I would run `pwd` (print working directory) and discover what directory in terminal (or iTerm) I am currently in 
i.e `/Users/sharonsena/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises` 

>2) Are you in the class directory?

I would run `pwd` to see if I am in the class directory  
If I am in the class directory, I would see `davinci_coders_t2_2015 sharonsena$`  
If I need to get to the class directory I would run `cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/` and it will return `davinci_coders_t2_2015 sharonsena$` putting me in the class directory

>3) Are you in your home directory?

I would run `cd` to go to my home directory
When I am in my home directly, I would see this in iTerm:  `apples-MacBook-Pro:~ sharonsena$`

>4) What directory did you run that command in?

I would run `pwd` to see what directory I am in
