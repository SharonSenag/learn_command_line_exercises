>What is your shell set to?

I would run `env` to get a list of hidden variables in my environment. 

When I run `env` it reveals `SHELL=/bin/bash`

>What directory are you in (don't use pwd this time)?

I would run `echo $PWD` to return my current directory:

/Users/sharonsena/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_21

>What is your home directory set to?

I would run `echo $HOME` to reveal my home directory:

/Users/sharonsena

>Can you set your environment to have DEBUG set to true?

To set your environment to have debug set to true: 

run `export DEBUG=true`
run `echo $DEBUG`
