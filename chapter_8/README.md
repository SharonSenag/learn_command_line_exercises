>pushd

The `pushd` command takes your current directory and "pushes" it into a list for later, then it changes to another directory. 

It's like saying, "Save where I am, then go here."

>popd

`popd` command "pops" to the last directory pushed and takes you back there

It makes it easy to switch between two directories if run with no arguments because it will switch between your current directory and the last one pushed.
